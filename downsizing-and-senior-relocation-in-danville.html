                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">After my husband passed, the thought of moving out of our family home was overwhelming. I reached out to KK Buys Indy Homes on a neighbor's recommendation, and I'm so glad I did. Kim and her team were patient, never rushing me, and helped me sort through decades of stuff. They connected me with local movers who handled my antique piano with extra care, and even arranged for donation pickups for things I didn't want to take. Start to finish took about six weeks, and I felt supported the whole time. I appreciated how they explained everything without jargon. Would use them again if needed.</div>

                </div>
                
                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">KK Buys Indy Homes was a big help with my parents' move last fall. We had a few hiccups – like the estate sale company canceling last minute – but Kim found a backup fast. Not everything went 100% smooth, but she always kept us updated. The house sold quicker than I expected, and she even checked in after closing to see how my folks were settling into their condo. Solid experience, would recommend, but be ready for a few bumps along the way.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">My sister and I hired KK Buys Indy Homes to help our mom downsize after 35 years in the same house. Kim was really understanding about how emotional it was for Mom and took her time walking her through each step. She didn't push us to make fast decisions and came by on weekends to fit our schedule. Also appreciated the moving checklist she gave us – super helpful. Took about a month to get everything sorted and sold. Only reason for 4 stars is we had some confusion with the storage unit rental at first, but Kim got it figured out fast.</div>

                        <summary>How long does the typical downsizing and relocation process take in the Danville area?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">The timeline varies based on your unique situation, but most clients in Danville complete their downsizing and relocation within 4 to 8 weeks from our initial meeting. This allows time for sorting, packing, arranging movers, and finalizing the sale of your current home. We work closely with you to create a schedule that fits your needs and any deadlines, such as closing dates for a new residence or moving into a senior community.</div>
